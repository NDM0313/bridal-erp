FIXES APPLIED:
==============

1.  FIXED: Modules\Connector\Routes\api.php
   - PROBLEM: Missing login endpoint, missing business-locations and dashboard-summary endpoints
   - SOLUTION: Completely rewrote api.php with:
     * Public login route at /connector/api/login (no auth required)
     * All authenticated routes use 'auth:api' middleware
     * Added business-locations GET endpoint  
     * Added dashboard-summary GET endpoint
     * All endpoints properly configured to return JSON
   - STATUS: Complete

2.  FIXED: Modules\Connector\Http\Controllers\Api\CommonResourceController.php
   - PROBLEM: Missing getBusinessLocations() and getDashboardSummary() methods
   - SOLUTION: Added two complete methods:
     * getBusinessLocations() - Returns list of business locations
     * getDashboardSummary() - Returns sales, expenses, purchases, cash-in-hand
   - STATUS: Complete

3.  FIXED: app\Http\Kernel.php
   - PROBLEM: 'auth:api' middleware not registered
   - SOLUTION: Added 'auth:api' => \Illuminate\Auth\Middleware\Authenticate::class
   - STATUS: Complete

4.  VERIFIED: config\auth.php
   - STATUS: API guard correctly configured with Passport driver
   - No changes needed
